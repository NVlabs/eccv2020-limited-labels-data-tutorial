Learning with limited data or labels remains an important unsolved problem in computer vision. It prevents us from democratizing AI technology today. While humans accomplish this task seamlessly, contemporary AI algorithms struggle with it. So, how far along have we come towards solving this problem in vision? What are some new frontiers to move forward? In this turorial we will explore several emerging ideas and exciting breakthroughs that are pushing the boundaries of what is possible for this task. We will first describe exciting new accomplishments in self-supervised learning from image collections and videos, which are helping to learn a myraid of vision tasks. Next we will show emerging ideas around learning with imperfect labels and of unification across different levels of supervision. Lastly, we will present two new ideas around inverting networks to provide data or feedback, which can help to learn in limited data  scenarios.
